# Basic-Console-based-Household-Budget-Planner
A simple C++ console-based Household Budget Planner that lets users set budgets, add expenses, and view monthly summaries. Built to strengthen core C++ fundamentals such as enums, functions, arrays, input validation, and formatted output.

This project showcases practical usage of core C++ concepts such as:

1.Enums
2.Functions
3.Arrays
4.Input validation
5.Formatting with <iomanip>
6.Program flow control
7.Basic budgeting logic
